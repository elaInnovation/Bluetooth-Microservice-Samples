# Bluetooth-Microservice-Sample
In this repository your will find all the samples provided by ELA Innovation around Bluetooth Base Microservice. We proposed here in different langage example the client side implementation for our Bluetooth Base Microservice available in our SDK. All the information relative to the SDK is available [here][here_ela_sdk]. If you need more information about the ELA Devices, you can reach our website by following this [link][here_ela_website].

Our sample are available in different langages:
- C#
- Python

## C#
We published some sample for Microsoft Visual Studio and C# langage. These sample try to give you an overview of the different way to integrate our microservice, our library to get the information of the Bluetooth Base Microservice on client side. We continue to publish sample on this repository. The different sample that you can find here are:

- **BlueBaseMicroservice-Sample**: this sample use C# and WPF to integrate the [Nuget Package elaMicroserviceClient][here_ela_nuget_msclient] in the application to get the data from Bluetooth Base Micorservice. Find the sample an explanation [here][here_csharp_nuget]
- **BlueBaseMicroservice-Sample-Grpc**: this sample use C# and WPF to integrate [elaMicroserviceGrpc project][here_ela_msgrpc] as a submodule in the application to get the data from Bluetooth Base Microservice. Find the sample an explanation [here][here_csharp_grpc]

## Python
We published some sample for python langage. This sample try to give you an overview of the different way to integrate our microservice to get the information of the Bluetooth Base Microservice on client side.
- **BlueBaseMicroservice-Sample-Grpc**: this sample coded in Python langage to integrate [elaMicroserviceGrpc project][here_ela_msgrpc] as a submodule in the application to get the data from Bluetooth Base Microservice. Find the sample an explanation [here][here_python_sample]
